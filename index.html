                    <p>A cliché that often applies to artists is that they come from bad or traumatic
                        childhoods. This is what made them into artists. In my case, it is true, except it
                        did
                        not make me into an artist, at least not immediately. The art would come later. As a
                        child, I was an athlete and a good student, and reading, writing, or playing
                        instruments
                        never happened, basically. I give props to my big brother Bob, however, for putting
                        together the soundtrack of my childhood. He played the guitar and had a vinyl
                        collection
                        and he provided a continuous stream of Beatles, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Queen, Pink
                        Floyd,
                        and more. It was my musical heritage, so to speak, even if I didn't know it or
                        realize
                        it until many years later. The one band that I could claim as mine was Kiss, and I
                        saw
                        them in concert in Fort Wayne in 1979, during the <i>Dynasty</i> tour and before
                        they unmasked
                        famously on MTV. Somehow I managed to acquire three of the four solo albums they did
                        (all but Gene Simmons'), and I saw the movie on TV in which the Kiss band members
                        played
                        superheroes. The Kiss concert was the first of what would become dozens of concerts
                        that
                        I would see. </p>

                <div class="tab-contents" id="first-efforts">
                    <p>I took the required music classes in elementary and middle school, and I remember
                        playing
                        the recorder and singing in choir in sixth grade, but I do not remember learning
                        theory
                        or being taught how to read music other than FACE for the spaces on the treble clef
                        and
                        EGBDF Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge for the lines on the staff (is that what you
                        call
                        it?). As I began to come of age, I started to listen to music of my own choosing and
                        artists at the top of my list were Duran Duran (Save a Prayer was my favorite),
                        Prince
                        and the Revolution (Purple Rain! I was 12 when it was released. ), and Mötley Crüe.
                        One
                        strange memory I have is listening to one and only one Rockline episode on the radio
                        when I lived in Indianapolis, during 8th grade, which must have been 1986-1987 and
                        the
                        following summer, before 9th grade, and the guest was R.E.M., no doubt there to
                        promote
                        their album <i>Document</i> and the single "The One I Love." I thought then that the
                        song was
                        something new, something I wanted more of, and I still think that it is R.E.M.'s
                        best
                        song. Nevertheless, I did not pursue R.E.M. after listening to the radio and I did
                        not
                        hear them again on any platform until 1991's <i>Out of Time</i>, when the band would
                        establish
                        itself on a global level. Why did I not pursue R.E.M. or any other musical artist at
                        that time? I would say it is because I had no external motivation, means, or support
                        to
                        go about it. I had no idea where to find R.E.M.'s music, I did not have MTV, and I
                        was
                        still generally interested in sports and baseball specifically. I collected baseball
                        cards and not albums, and that was that. </p><br>
                    <p>In high school, back in Fort Wayne, I did begin to pursue hair metal bands and I even
                        saw
                        Poison, Ratt, and Cinderella in concert. In the summer of 1988, however, my
                        definition
                        of "good music" began to change. A friend of mine (thanks Brian!) kept talking to me
                        about this song called "Welcome to the Jungle" and how kickass it was. Then, perhaps
                        by
                        dumb luck or fate, I heard "Sweet Child O' Mine" by the same band and before hearing
                        "Jungle." What a revelation it was! It sounded authentic, raw, raunchy, and
                        basically
                        like rock should sound. Guns N' Roses became my gateway band in that moment. First,
                        I
                        bought the cassette two or three times and wore it out each time in my 1976
                        Mustang's (a
                        Fastback) tape deck from playing it so much. GNR was my first musical obsession.
                        Second,
                        as my obsession grew, I paid attention to the (electric) guitar playing for the
                        first
                        time, and I was able to distinguish between Izzy's parts and Slash's parts. GNR
                        <i>Lies</i>
                        enhanced my obsession. Additionally, my success in purchasing the GNR album led me
                        to
                        purchase albums by other, little-known-to-me artists, such as N.W.A., The Black
                        Crowes,
                        and more.

                <div class="tab-contents" id="towards-the-muse">
                    <p>If GNR was the gateway to music listening for me, Nirvana was the gateway to playing
                        an
                        instrument. On September 17, 1991, I was the first in line at the music store in the
                        mall to purchase <i>Use Your Illusion</i>. It was a great collection of songs, and I
                        still
                        listen to it occasionally, but the following week Nirvana would blow the doors off
                        the
                        establishment with the release of <i>Nevermind</i>. Of course, I did not hear
                        anything from it
                        until probably November, 1991. One night while at my mother's house, I was listening
                        to
                        local 103.9 (WXKE --The Rock) on her big console stereo when I heard the opening
                        notes
                        for "Come As You Are." When the song finished, I had the same feeling that I did
                        when I
                        heard "The One I Love" or "Sweet Child": I just knew that things were going to
                        change
                        for me. I went out that week and bought <i>Nevermind</i>, which was when I heard
                        "Smells Like
                        Teen Spirit" and the rest of the album for the first time. I was in college and was
                        able
                        to watch some MTV in a commons area in one of my buildings, and the video for "Teen
                        Spirit" just crushed me. Wait a minute! Teens burning down their high school? Hell
                        yes!
                        It was on MTV that I saw and heard Pearl Jam's "Alive" for the first time, and
                        later, in
                        an apartment I shared with two dudes from high school, I saw and heard for the first
                        time, again on MTV, "Cherub Rock" by The Smashing Pumpkins. All of this was so new,
                        so
                        weird, and so great, not to mention Romantic. I was learning all kinds of things in
                        my
                        college classes, meeting new people, reading novels for pleasure (<i>The Sun Also
                            Rises</i> by
                        Hemingway was chief among them), learning a new language (Spanish), and dating girls
                        for
                        the first time, and the music that changed American popular culture also changed me.
                        I
                        eventually purchased an acoustic guitar, an Alvarez. Despite my great intentions, my
                        self-taught approach fizzled fast as my fingers were always in pain and I was not
                        ready
                        to commit to the 10,000 hours it would take to master the instrument. I put it away,
                        taking it out occasionally over the years, replacing it with an Epiphone, adding to
                        it
                        an electric guitar, and putting away my desire to play the guitar.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-contents" id="the-muse">
                    <p>What pushed me to finally learn the guitar well enough to write songs was developing
                        a
                        relationship with my eventual wife. I was so enamored that I began to write words
                        and
                        poetry and song verses and that pushed me into playing the guitar and then putting
                        the
                        words to music and the rest is history. Today, after 17 years of marriage, I still
                        write
                        songs for her. It will likely never stop, and those original songs and the
                        creativity
                        and skills I developed as a guitar player, while still not being those of a
                        virtuoso,
                        have led me into songs about other themes and also into writing fiction following
                        the
                        path of Hemingway, the gatekeeper that led me to García Márquez, Fuentes, Kerouac,
                        Vargas Llosa, Plath, Carpentier, and many other great writers.</p>

        <h2 class="fade-in">The Murmurations</h2>
        <div class="murmurations-text-box fade-in">
            <p class="band-text"><strong>The Murmurations</strong> formed in 2017 when I asked some friends to
                help me
                take <i>In the Shadow of the Bird Queen</i>
                to the stage. They were: Tyler Damerell (guitar), Chris Ratsabout (guitar), Sean Wooldridge
                (drums),
                Dave Baker (keys), and Brian Spahr (bass). I played rhythm guitars and added the vocals, and we
                played
                shows together before sadly our friend Dave went on to play keys for God in Heaven and Brian
                soon
                thereafter had some health issues and he had to step away from the band. A lean and mean
                foursome moved
                forward with Chris on bass. Covid-19 happened and the band did nothing for a while before moving
                into a
                recording project that became <i>Box of Stars</i>, which was eventually recorded and mixed at
                Silverbirch
                Studios in Fort Wayne in April, 2021. After some shows the band moved into our next recording
                project
                and the album that became <i>Kids</i>. We tracked the album at our homes and eventually Chris
                became the
                engineering force, with assistance from the rest of the band, that would finish the album and
                get it the
                sound that you can now hear on Spotify, Apple Music, etc. He also did the artwork. Tyler and
                Sean added
                harmonies, and all of us together worked on the arrangements. As the album was near completion,
                Chris
                made it known that he was leaving the band, which he did in March, 2022. The album was released
                on May
                24, 2022, and since then we have played shows with several people filling spots, including
                Brandon
                Williams (bass), Tim Hardiek (drums), and Lance Holder (drums). Lance is our drummer as we move
                into
                2024.</p>

                <p><strong><i>The Appleseeds </i></strong>is an urban Midwestern tale
                    of
                    aspiration, love and
                    loss, and redemption, in which Andrew Apple, the protagonist and principal narrator,
                    pursues
                    a life that reflects his subjective identity as an artist and musician. As the dream
                    grows
                    closer to becoming objective reality, the iniquity that pervades the personages of
                    Apple’s
                    inner circle diverts him from his righteous and self-affirming path, leading to the
                    death of
                    his friend and collaborator, his own moral collapse, and the disintegration of the dream
                    and
                    band known as The Appleseeds. Andrew’s subsequent exile from his hometown of Fort Wayne,
                    Indiana, and the life he dreamed ultimately results in redemption, which he achieves
                    through
                    the love of an unforeseen soul. In the end, the songs of The Appleseeds are the only
                    evidence that remains of the dream. </p>

                    Lindo Dixon comes of age in this episodic account of the

                    forgotten by trickle-down economics -- with the help of baseball, friends, and some

                    is the undulating and fragmented first-person testimony of Eddie Azure of the
                    divine among us, which is embodied by the teenage bird goddess, Avía Skye.The
                    evangelical
                    tale of their convergence as lovers and of the dramatic end is at once a lyrical and
                    labyrinthine lamentation of love and loss, an object lesson on obsession, and a descent
                    to
                    darkness.
